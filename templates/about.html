				<p class="heading"><strong>I'm <em>Brandon Thomas</em>, an (undergrad) researcher</strong>&mdash;something of a futurist, too. My academic interests include things that bridge computers and people; computation and life. <small>(ie. molecular biology, cognitive science, vision and perception, semantics, data visualization, social graphs, interest/attention mining and training, state space, combinatorial mathematics, AI, metaheuristics, and most fundamentally, exploring the nature and fabric of computation.)</small></p>

				<p>I believe that everything can be automated. It's just a matter of understanding the process behind a given phenomena. That's where I want to come in.</p>

				<p><big>My interest in the Semantic Web:</big> I'd like to think that someday soon we will manage to stitch together the entire breadth of human knowledge and communication, enabling us to extrapolate and correlate data with remarkable speed. <small>(Note: this isn't the same as just &ldquo;putting it out there&rdquo;.)</small> Resources and relevant information will find their way into our hands, with our without a direct conscious search on our part. This will be mediated by computers programmed to semantically analyze data, user interest and attention, social circumstance, and research objectives. To this end, one of my principle devotions has been in the engineering of a distributed social Semantic Web communications and data exchange system. It's quite a complicated problem though, and it's taken me a number of years to even characterize the basics.</p>

				<p><big>My recent dive into computational bio[chem|physics|engineering|...]:</big> I'm just getting started in this field, but I think it holds quite a lot of promise. High-throughput biology is the dream of many researchers, and careful application of computer automation techniques will undoubtably shave years off of painstaking lab procedure. I really want to help make that happen... in doing so I may even learn more to further my own research objectives.</p>
